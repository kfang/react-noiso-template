# Getting Started
Requirements:
1. git
2. npm
3. webpack

Running:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. open a browser and go to [http://localhost:3001](localhost:3001)

Deployment:
1. `npm run build`
2. Take '/index.html' and '/build/bundle.js' and put it on your preferred
webserver. Be smart, use CI.

# Why?
- Because sometimes, we don't need all the isomorphism complicated-ness...
- And not all of us run servers with node.js (_apache_ *cough *cough)
- Good starter if you just want to learn ReactJS
- Setting up projects is always a pain. Just clone and go.
